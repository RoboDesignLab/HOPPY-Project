%	Inputs:	

%              t : A column vector that contains the time values for the

%                  corresponding computed state trajectory points

%              x : A matrix in which each row is a state value on the 

%                  solution trajectory that corresponds to the time value in

%                  vector t with the same row value. Format of each row:

%                          row = [x1 x2 ... xN]

%              Fs: The sampling frequency (1/sec) for the evenly sampled 

%                  set to be generated.

%

%       Outputs:

%              Et : Even sampling instants. This is a column vector in the

%                   same format with "t".

%              Ex : A matrix of the same form with "x" that contains the

%                   state values corresponding to the time instants in Et
